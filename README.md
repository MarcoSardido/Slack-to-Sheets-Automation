# SmartInvoice Flow: Slack-to-Sheets Automation

## ðŸ“„ Description

This workflow streamlines invoice management by automatically processing PDFs or images of invoices sent in Slack. Once an invoice is uploaded, the system extracts key details (e.g., items, prices, totals) using OCR and AI, then logs the data into a structured Google Sheet. Finally, a summary of the parsed data is sent back to Slack for confirmationâ€”eliminating manual entry and reducing errors.

## Features

- **Google Sheets Logging**: Saves extracted invoice data into a preformatted Google Sheet for easy tracking and reporting.
- **Automated Confirmation**: Sends a summary of the extracted invoice details back to Slack for user review and confirmation.
